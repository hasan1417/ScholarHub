# Project Reference Suggestions

## Purpose
Verify that the Project references tab surfaces pending suggestions, supports refresh, and allows approving or rejecting references.

## Setup
- Backend running with `PROJECT_REFERENCE_SUGGESTIONS_ENABLED=true`.
- Legacy Migration project populated with papers and references (migration script executed).
- Frontend dev server running at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Account: `g202403940@kfupm.edu.sa` / `testpass123`.

## Test Data
- Existing references attached to papers via the migration script.

## Steps
1. Log in and open the Legacy Migration project.
2. Switch to the Related Papers tab.
3. Click “Refresh suggestions”.
4. Approve one suggestion and reject another.

## Expected Results
- Refresh call reports whether new suggestions were created.
- Suggestions list renders each reference title, metadata, and related paper list.
- Approving removes the suggestion from the pending list (and attaches to the project/paper).
- Rejecting removes the suggestion without attaching it.

## Rollback
No rollback required; suggestions can be re-generated by running refresh again.

## Evidence
- Manual verification; no screenshot captured.
